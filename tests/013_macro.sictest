;; Basic tests for macros.  Could probably use more but I don't wanna.


(defmacro q3 (a b c) (list quote (list a b c)))

(test "macros don't evaluate their arguments"
      (assert-eq? '(1 (+ 2 3) (+ 4 5)) (q3 1 (+ 2 3) (+ 4 5)))

      (let ( (lq3 (macro (a b c) (list quote (list a b c)))) )
        (assert-eq? '(1 (+ 2 3) (+ 4 5)) (lq3 1 (+ 2 3) (+ 4 5)))
        )
      )
